# Exercise-4_Word-Analyzer
I planned for the output to be displayed (vowel, consonant, character) to be empty instead of showing '0' from the start therefore I set all the variables to " instead of '0' for the super (). To start the counter in Analyzeword (), I use the net to define and initialize the variables as 0. (Counting vowels, consonants, and characters). Put the length of the input word into 'char' to get the total number of characters. I use the for loop to count vowels and consonants, with 'if' for vowels and 'else if' for consonants. I use 'if' and 'else if' instead of 'if' and 'else' because I want to distinguish between vowels and consonants while also not counting the ‘spaces’ and numbers in the ‘else' whenever the input has been entered. Regardless of whether the output is uppercase or lowercase, the vowels and consonants are tallied as one in the output. The spaces within the word are also counted in the total number of characters.
